*Group Project 

A large hotel unit, ASDF Palace, provides hospitality services
managed rooms and restaurants, bars, gyms, meeting rooms, etc.

The company is already taking successful steps in its digital transformation
its functions. Under the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company implements all
protocols for the safety of staff and visitors and at the same time the
management wishes to take additional measures to minimize risks and
effects on the health of employees and visitors, as well as on timely reception
measures by the company in the event of a case.

The goal is to minimize customer contact with shared switches and
handles, doors and lifts, and no transactions (with credit
or cash) for the use of the hotel services. In case someone from
the guest is found to be positive, immediately the movements can be traced
and his / her contacts in order to deal with the most probable ones in time
cases of virus spread.
This tracking is implemented with the use of NFC bracelets, mandatory for all the customers.

Our task was to create the database and, while making good use of the NFC bracelets, implementing a Web Service-Control UI for the staff in order to make this tracking possible.
